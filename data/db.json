      "details": "Introduction\nMany projects on the web need to interface with a REST API at some stage in their development. Axios is a lightweight HTTP client based on the $http service within Angular.js v1.x and is similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API.\n\nAxios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.\n\nYou can also intercept and cancel requests, and there’s built-in client-side protection against cross-site request forgery.\n\nIn this article, you will see examples of how to use Axios to access the popular JSON Placeholder API within a React application.\n\n",
