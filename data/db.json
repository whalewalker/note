      "details": "Introduction\nMany projects on the web need to interface with a REST API at some stage in their development. Axios is a lightweight HTTP client based on the $http service within Angular.js v1.x and is similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API.\n\nAxios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.\n\nYou can also intercept and cancel requests, and there’s built-in client-side protection against cross-site request forgery.\n\nIn this article, you will see examples of how to use Axios to access the popular JSON Placeholder API within a React application.\n\n",

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.\n\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.\n\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\n\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.",
